This is a Heroku app that is not yet deployed because the functionality is not ready.

Once it is functional, the user may enter a burger they'd like to eat by typing it into the text field and clicking "submit". They may eat a burger by clicking the "DEVOUR" button next to the burger's name. Burgers that have already been devoured will appear on the right hand side.

The problem I'm having is mostly with rendering the burger_name in handlebars. The burger_name is currently rendering to the database, but isn't rendering to handlebars. The devour button is also currently broken.
